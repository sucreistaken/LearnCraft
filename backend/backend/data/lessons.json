Please look at the couple of slides for assignments (marked with TODO) A problem: source of information Declarative Programming • In • Flutter • React/React Native • Jetpack Compose (Android) • Swift UI (iOS) we create the user interface in a style called “declarative programming”. • The kind of programming that most of you are used to is called “imperative programming”. • Android SDK • iOS SDK • What is the difference? What exactly are they? A computer program vs. an electronic circuit Imperative vs. Declarative Imperative Declarative • Giving orders in detail, with explicit instructions • Describing how it should be • Do this, then do that, then do this other thing. • Programmer has full control. • Programmer has full responsibility. • The computer is dumb. • Here is how I would like it to look like. I don’t have control over how exactly you are doing it. • Programmer has limited control. • Programmer has limited responsibility. • The computer is smart. Imperative vs. Declarative Imperative Declarative • Java • C++ • Step-by-step programming • HTML • SQL • Designing a circuit-like system • Procedural languages • Functional languages Is it just the language? • No, it’s the style. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mt7KnvnNGfk How are React Native and Flutter Declarative? • JavaScript and Dart are procedural languages. Shouldn’t it be imperative? • Answer: there are imperative parts of your code. The code that generates the UI is declarative. Declarative code from React Native and Flutter. Declarative code from React Native and Flutter. • Although the language is suitable for imperative code, the framework forces declarative code. • You create and tie UI elements together. • You do not modify or manage existing UI elements. • There is no such code in either: • txtField.text = “new text” • pnlMain.addChild(txtField) • Instead, there is such code: • new Panel(new TextField(“hello”)); UI Code • React Native • JSX • (short for JavaScript XML) • Similar to HTML • The description for the UI. Creates the UI. • Not actual code • Limited customization • No debugging • Flutter • Widget constructors • Named parameters • child for single child • children for multiple • Actual code! • Fully customizable • Fully debuggable UI is a tree • The UI is a tree structure • Creating a tree is easy • Modifying and maintaining a tree is difficult • This is why they chose declarative • We create and re-create UI elements. We do not manage existing elements. • What? How? • How do you make a text field say “one” first, and then say “two” after you press a button? Imperative Example • How do you make a text field say “one” first, and then say “two” after you press a button? Panel panel = new Panel(); TextField t = new TextField(); panel.add(t); t.text = “one”; Button b = new Button(); panel.add(b); b.addClickHandler(() { t.text = “two”; }); • THIS IS IMPERATIVE CODE. THIS MAKES SENSE. • This is not how React Native or Flutter do it. Declarative Example • How do you make a text field say “one” first, and then say “two” after you press a button? String currentValue = “one”; buildUi() { new Panel( new Text(currentValue), new Button( onClick: () { currentValue = “two”; rebuildUi(); } ) ) } • THIS IS DECLARATIVE CODE. THIS IS COUNTER-INTUITIVE • Why does React Native and Flutter use this pattern? Compare them. Panel panel = new Panel(); TextField t = new TextField(); panel.add(t); t.text = “one”; Button b = new Button(); panel.add(b); b.addClickHandler(() { String currentValue = “one”; buildUi() { new Panel( new Text(currentValue), new Button( onClick: () { currentValue = “two”; rebuildUi(); } ) t.text = “two”; }); ) } The difference • Imperative • Declarative • You create elements • You attach them together • You create elements • You attach them together • You keep a reference to elements • You do not keep a reference to elements • You are not responsible for maintaining elements • You do not give them orders • You create them and forget about them • You are responsible for mainaining them • You give them orders • You recreate them when something changes How can you keep recreating the UI? • Isn’t it inefficient? How can you keep recreating the UI? • Isn’t it inefficient? • NO! People smarter than us have implemented it carefully. • What you are creating is not the real UI element. It’s just a light description of them. • Very light data structure, system is ok with creating and destroying them quickly. • The framework finds the difference between two versions of the tree and modifies the UI elements whose description actually changed. • Carefully crafted framework to give you the ability to “just recreate the UI”. • DO NOT TRY TO OPTIMIZE ANYTHING ABOUT IT!!! • DO NOT CACHE UI ELEMENTS, ETC. KEEP RECREATING THEM. Planning and Creating a Declarative UI • How should you go about planning your UI? • https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html •FilterableProductTable • SearchBar • ProductTable • ProductCategoryRow • ProductRow How does data flow? https://livebook.manning.com/book/react-in-action/chapter-3/112 How does data flow? https://www.slideshare.net/pheadra4/react-46872849?from_action=save How does data flow? https://www.slideshare.net/pheadra4/react-46872849?from_action=save How does data flow? • Unidirectional data flow • Top to bottom • Props/constructor arguments (fixed) • Data being passed down when component is created (yellow). • State (changing) • Temporary data that changes with user input or other events • Triggers a rebuild of subtree.

    "slideText": "So I just made an introduction and reminder about what we did the last two weeks. Also in Panopto I saw some incomplete recordings but there were a lot of recordings so I'm not sure what happened. Maybe we lost like one hour last week. But like I said before, those are all secondary sources. Main sources you need to be here and listening to the lecture. Okay so like I said we covered a lot of things. I hope you are able to watch them through Panopto if not you can ask me always. And today I intend to dive into the code as much as possible. But before that I'd like to give you some ideas about what declarative UI means. I talked about it very briefly but I will dive into it today as much as possible without seeing code. Hopefully when you see the code it will make sense but I want to talk about it before that. I talked about two luxuries of Flutter that we repeat them. We ran the app and then we took it into a mode which is selection mode. And then I did some things in the app and then I took it to that mode and then I tapped on something on my screen. It took me to the code in my project that created that UI element. So I didn't have to go through my project or where is this, where is this. I immediately went there. So that was one luxury of Flutter and I will repeat that later as we start using it again. Another luxury was I edited some code, saved it and immediately like less than a second usually later I saw it, I saw my running app change to reflect that. And it was preserving the current state. So that's really valuable because I gave you the example of you are an intern, went to a company, let's say it's an e-commerce app and then people add something to the cart, they create this state like maybe you add some discounts, maybe you use some components, etc. And when you're checking out something weird is happening, right? So it's a really convoluted state that you're taking that into. So you change something there and then you save it, you run the app and then you see oh it's not very good. So you go back, change something, put the app in that state again, it's not very good. But you don't have that in Flutter. In Flutter you are in that state, you put the app in that state, you need all that in the app as a user and then you change the code. You save it, you need to see the change in the running version of the app while preserving its state. So this is immensely valuable and it reduces the loop that I talked about. So you change something, you run it, you see the result and then you change again. So that loop took hours back in the days in C++, even still current projects. But those are tough life, that's a tough developer's life. But we are living in a luxurious world with Flutter. I told you that developer experience is unmatched pretty much. It has a really nice developer experience. The two luxuries that I just talked about, tap on something, change code, you need to see it. These are luxuries that we get to live with. And you will find that gives a lot of pleasure to the developer as you quickly mould your application. It feels like you're playing with labels, it feels like you're shaking a lot with your hands, drawing something rather than writing code and trying to guess what happened. So I want you to have that kind of experience and if it's not that, just let me know and let's see what you're doing wrong. And let me try to help you. The third luxury of Flutter is declarative UI, which I called Markler. And I have some slides to explain that and this is pretty much the last set of slides I have. The rest of the semester will be all on my laptop, looking at some documentation, me coding in front of you, etc. So a problem in UI software is source of information. Where is the data coming from? Which data am I supposed to show it on the screen right now? I'm sure you all had back in the day when we were using Oasis. You read the message, but it still shows 200 messages, right? You read it, you read it, it still shows. So this is such an example, right? The information that goes there, the source was incorrect. In that case, it was a backend issue. A lot of times in a UI, there is some data that comes from the internet, from the network, and it's in your application right now, in some variables. And you show it on some screen, you also show it in different parts of the application. One of them changes what's going to happen, it has to go and change everything else. And then this changes, it needs to change everything else also. So this effect, this one, this effect, this one, you can see it becomes a spaghetti code very quickly. Unless you have some kind of structure to this data flow. So let me remember to change this part. So now whenever this line of code runs, it touches many places in the app. And then whenever this part runs, it touches many places in the app. You can even go into loop sometimes, right? This changed, why did this change? Did the user change it? Or did it change? Because of this change, then it affected this change, right? And then you can go into loops, you can try to find out what's going on, this is very crazy. And we talked about swing library last time. It's imperative, you can have situations like that in such libraries, okay? So this declarative UI is invented to get around this issue completely. And also user interfaces are usually like trees, okay? So you have a user interface, you have an app, and then you have the top side. And then, you know, there's a little button icon here, there's another icon here, there's a title. Maybe I'll just write it actually. And there's a list of elements, and there's another thing, you know, standard, classic user interface, right? So this is a tree, what do you mean this is a tree? This larger area contains a smaller area, which contains a smaller area, which contains a smaller area, okay? That's how it's a tree. So this large area, this thing, okay, let's start it this way, contains this title, which contains this little thing and that little thing and the title text, okay? So this is the parent, this is the child, this contains this tree, and then let's go to blue. So this contains this area, which contains this element, this element, this element, okay? So you can see how it's a tree, right? Visually, I'm showing it to you, I don't think there's any question about that. So another part here, maybe it has some elements, maybe yes, hello. And then the hello is a child, okay? So this is a tree, tree structure. Any question about that? No. You learned about trees before, and this is clear, there's a tree structure, there's no loops. It's a parent-child relationship going on. So have you learned any algorithms about trees, tree traversal in algorithms course? And yeah, was it easy? No. No, okay, to be honest, yeah, when they give you complicated situations around algorithms and etc. Traverse these trees, in order to traversal, blah, blah, blah. Okay, so human beings aren't very good at dealing with trees, okay? So this is one, something that I want you to hold in your head. I will come to that soon. This decorative UI is also trying to overcome that difficulty. As a human being, it's difficult for you to deal with trees, traverse trees, maintain trees, right? Let's say you have a button over here, and when you press that button, you want this thing to change. So you have a reference from this to this, and then you're able to also, everybody, and then things go crazy. Okay, you tend to add something here, you hold on to this reference, maybe it's deleted now, you're holding on to the old bad reference. All kinds of weird scenarios happen when you put a UI developer in front of a CS problem, okay? So you can imagine the mismatch there. So, and the source of information problem that I've also said, these kinds of apps usually have either inside the UI elements or somewhere central, there is data, okay? And these things modify that data, and that data is supposed to be reflected. Maybe this is showing the old version of data, like 200 messages, but this one read the message, so what's going to happen? Is it going to talk to this one, is it going to say this one, and then we'll talk back to this one, and there's some kind of mechanism that needs to happen so that everything reflects the latest data, okay? So this source of information problem lies in the center of some of the difficulties that I tried to explain. And we have this tree structure, this data moves to go into the different parts of the tree somehow, different parts of the tree will change that data, it will be reflected in other parts of the tree, so it can become a difficult task just to create a user interface, a user code, okay? So there is something called declarative programming, declarative user interfaces, but more generally declarative programming, okay? Let's try to understand what I mean by that, and as we start to use Flutter, I will always point to it. Remember, you know, I talked about declarative programming, so now we are doing it. So in Flutter, in the React-Reacted, React Composites, we are also using this approach. You are creating user interfaces in a style called declarative programming, or declarative UI. Okay, declarative means declare, I'm declaring it to you, I'm describing it to you, I'm saying, oh, it is ahead, it has a body, two arms and two legs, so I'm describing something, okay? That's the idea, you are programming in a way you are describing things, okay? I'm not telling you, okay, get ahead, get a body, attach it to the head, get an arm, attach it to this part, and get another arm, attach it to here, get a leg, attach it to here, get a leg, attach it to here, you know? What I just did when I drew this picture, I gave you some orders, right? That's the difference, I told you, okay, get this picture. But in this one, I explained to you, there's a head, there are arms, it's not important if you took the arms first or the legs first, I'm just telling you, it's up to you to however you want to draw it, but here I gave you step-by-step orders in a sequence, I told you, put the arms now, create the arms, etc. So this is declarative, this is imperative, which you don't call it, okay? So the kind of program that most of you are usually called imperative program, imperative means to give orders, do this, do that, completely stupid, you tell it to do whatever, every time, okay? It doesn't know anything, it's just waiting for your orders, you tell it to do something, okay? Just like I tried to explain. So you have to tell the computer, put the head on this coordinate, put the body on this coordinate, okay? So I'm going to SDK, I'm going to SDK, by default, native apps are using imperative program, imperative program is difficult, because you assume that the computer is done and you have a lot of responsibility on your shoulders to make things right. Because this program is easier, in this case you are describing things, you are given a set of tools that lets you describe something, okay? And leave the details to the system, that's the tricky part, okay? I'm describing it and I'm leaving the details to the system for it to draw the guy. I told it there's an arm, there's a head, etc. and it drew. But in here I told you maybe even more decorative, go to this coordinate, draw a circle, go to this coordinate, draw a line down, okay? So that's the kind of imperative that we are talking about. Imperative means giving orders, okay? So before the development is like this, but Jetpack Components with UI are changing it to make native app development more declarative. So basically, first React and React Native came out. I mean, there is more history, but the most famous example is React, basically, for web, and it introduced declarative programming to the masses. And then React Native followed what you can do with an app like that. And Flutter also created a declarative framework in a different approach, but whatever you learn here, you'll be useful in React Native because you learn about declarative, how to deal with declarative, okay? It's a light bulb that needs to go in your head at some point. For some people it never goes on, they just say, okay, this is how you do it. But if you stop and think about it, what am I doing? And then you're going to get much better results. Okay, after this, after the success of this, right, the native, we already did two interfaces, and they are also different because they are imperative. And then Flutter and React Native came out, they were so much easier compared to them. And then the native guys said, okay, we have to also do declarative, and then they did get their components, you try, for the Android and others, and you get applications in the perfect way, okay? So I told you a lot of high levels without any details, but what's the details, what exactly are they? Let's try to understand a little bit more. Any questions? You're free to stop. Okay, so you can think of it like a computer program versus an electronic circuit. There are a bunch of different ways to think about this. Did you take electronic circuits, courses, anything like that? Okay, so an electronic circuit, you have a battery, and then you plug a bunch of things. You say, okay, there's a light, there's a resistor here, et cetera, you put them together, and the button, and then you press the button, it runs, okay? You don't say, okay, electron, go forward, and then turn this light on, et cetera, you don't give those kinds of orders. You set it up, you press the button, it happens, okay? You describe the circuit, press the button, and it runs by itself. Okay, you put things together, and it runs by itself. So it's going to be more like that, like an electronic circuit, when you go through the apps. But the computer program is like, okay, I have line one, line two, line three, I run this line, and then once it's done, I go to the next one. And then I go to the next one, set of sequential instructions that somebody executes, a computer executes, line by line, like a dumb machine. It has variables, et cetera, and then you put all kinds of things you do with it. But the idea is that step by step, you tell it what it needs to do, okay? Versus, yes, circuit, you can put it in any order, you set it up, you take some time to set it up, and you press, but it runs by itself, okay? So computer program is more like imperative code that you are used in your Java course, for example. But electronic circuit is more like declarative programming, which we will do today, hopefully. Okay, so one more comparison. Interactive is doing orders in detail with its explicit instructions. Do this, then do that, then do this other thing. Do this, do this, do that, step, do this, step, et cetera. It's your fault. You have to do it in detail, what you do next. In declarative, you describe how it should be, okay? Here's how I would like, how I would like it to be like. I'm not controlling how exactly you're doing it, but this is what, this is my recipe. This is what I want to see, this is what I want to happen, and then please make it happen. It's the idea. So when your program is integrated, you find yourself writing out a code that describes user interfaces rather than any complicated code you put over here, et cetera. So differences, program has full control in imperative, full responsibility in imperative, okay? And you assume that the computer is done, you have to think about everything. This is not like, you have libraries of course, all library functions, all objects that are in libraries that make your job easier, you can integrate it, but at the end of the day, what happens after what is up to you, and you have to maintain that. In declarative world, your program has limited control, but has limited responsibility also, right? So you only focus on what you want to do. I want the user interface that reacts to data that shows the case, and I want to focus on that. I don't want to focus on bits and bytes and whatever happens in the computer inside. You know, I don't want to focus on that, I want to focus on my user interface. That's usually a good thing to have. And the computer is somewhat smart. You give it these instructions, and then it does some things that you don't want to do, such as treat traverses. Okay? So this imperative and declarative, it's a continuum, really. It's not a discrete thing. Something can be more declarative than something else, etc. But at the end of the day, what we mean is going to be you can reuse your interfaces. But until we come to that, let's talk about, there are some languages that naturally get you to create, sort of imperative code. Java, for example, you write a Java code, line-by-line, you say, c++, step-by-step, any kind of programming. But it's also in here. You might be surprised. Flutter has a dark language that we use. It's also an imperative language, by default. But we will talk about what makes it imperative. Okay? These are also procedural languages, imperative languages. Some declarative languages. Some languages are declarative. So you have to, when you use them, you have to integrate them. You have to describe it by the nature of the language. HTML, for example, if you have a code with a website, it's not a tag, you say, HTML, body, and then maybe a form. And the form is closed. So you basically can use the form, use something, use something else, right? If you're complaining, you're telling your computer, there must be this over here. You're not saying, step-by-step, do this and that. You have to create a document, you give it to the computer, you give it to the web browser, you can interpret it to make a website. Okay? SQL, SQL is also, I think, it's a database process, no? Yeah, that's a language that's declarative, in which you declare what you want to have. Okay, from this table, I want to find the largest element. You don't say, go, open that table, go to the first row, go to the next one. You just describe your problem, describe what you want, and it actually executes behind the scenes. Designing a circuit like system, whatever name, VHL, use the use for circuits. And all the functional languages are kind of in this area. So a language can be equivalent, a language can be declarative, meaning that when you write something with a language, you are either acting inequality or acting inequality. Okay? But in the case of VHL, like I said, it's an inequality language, right? So we will talk about what makes it different. Okay, so is it just a language? No. But definitely languages are inequality languages. But you have an inequality language by VHL, and you can write some code, more inequality, you know, more declaratively. You can compare it, say continuum, like that. You say, okay, this is my list of numbers, I have an empty list of numbers, and I will make it forward to a one by one, double that, and then add it to that other list. And that's it, right? So it is very important to do this, how can we do that? And here you say, okay, I have a list, and I have this function that doubles things. I want to apply that function on every element of this list, and give you the result, and you can do it, okay? This is more different, this is more different, but the difference between them is, this is a little more different. You are saying, okay, there's this function, apply it, I don't care how you apply it, et cetera. Okay? We'll talk about that. It's a statically typed language, it has a history, initially it was created to replace JavaScript, so it was very loosely typed in the beginning, then over the years they made it very strongly typed, but loosely typed is also a possibility, it's possible to use it that way, but we don't use it that way. Yes, it's similar to TypeScript, yes, in a way, yes. But closer to Java than TypeScript. TypeScript is a little more different than... ...Java. Basically, it's somewhere between Java and JavaScript, I would say. That was the target audience when they created it. Okay, so your language can be imperative, but you can write somehow declarative code with it. So how do we react if you want to declare it? JavaScript can now add procedural languages, imperative languages, okay? I will put them on the left in a couple of slides back. Not like HTML or SQL, etc. Okay, so it's a lot of both procedural languages. Should be imperative, it would be the question. There are, there will be imperative parts of your code. A lot of parts of your code will be imperative. You write a function, you write one line, code index, imperative, okay? But this is the most important part of this lecture perhaps. The code that generates the UI is declarative. Okay, and how we will talk about that. Okay, so if you create a Flutter application, you look at your main function, you look at the function, it's a function, line by line, front. But then you see things inside each other. Material app, title, text, etc. It looks a little different, it's still code. It looks a little different. They created the library so that you are forced to write declarative UI in an imperative language. Okay, it is a work of art. And I'll show you what's in the library's description. So basically, dark is an imperative language, procedural language, and part of your code, part of your code is imperative. But the code that generates the UI is declarative. Okay, the code that generates the UI, generates the user interface is imperative because they created the library to force you to do that. You cannot do it any other way, okay? And we will talk about that. Okay, so this is ReactMade in a Flutter. Sorry, it's a dark or clear, but React is ReactMade for five years on this course. It's left out, but you definitely will find it useful. So this is ReactMade. This is type script, JavaScript, line by line, front, front, welcome screen, creates a variable. And then, this is the inline function, and it goes into a mode in which you write the HTML. Okay, remember I called HTML as a declarative language. In ReactMade and React, you are writing JavaScript, and then you put HTML like code, JSX code, which looks very much like HTML, XML, inside your JavaScript. Let's do that. So to make ReactMade declarative, they modified the language so that you can put HTML like code inside JavaScript. Okay, because HTML is a declarative language, JavaScript is not a declarative language. To make you use an interface declarative, they let you, in React and ReactMade, put HTML inside JavaScript. JSX, take a quick look. Okay, so it says, okay, there's a view here, there's a header in it, there's a text in it, there's a text described, okay? There's another text in it, okay? So in that, in Flutter, what they did is, this is not HTML. They put these up all into the parentheses. This looks like a function called f-bar. There is the, I told you last time, there's the optional new keyword, where you have the name of a class, and parentheses, can you call that class now? In Java, you put new person, right? And new f-bar. There's an optional new keyword. You can also put that new keyword. Back in the day, it was mandatory. Later, to make it more cleaner, they made the new keyword optional. So if you just use a class name, parentheses, you're calling the constructor of it. And there's a new place, new keyword, as if you want to do a new keyword, okay? So basically, this is creating a parameter space. This is creating a center in a space and giving some parameters to it. And then there's the concept of made parameters, okay? So for example, let's get the scaffold. Scaffold parameters is, so I'm creating a scaffold. I'm calling it new scaffold, okay? It's a new scaffold. And then the first parameter is f-bar column. So these are name parameters. In Java, you don't have name parameters, right? Your parameters have names, but when you're calling the function, you don't give them. In that way, there's the option of having name parameters in functions, okay? And this is calling the scaffold constructor, and it's calling the f-bar constructor, and I'm passing it as a parameter. First parameter, scaffold constructor. It's calling the center constructor, center class constructor. And to that, it's giving the column class constructor, to that, it's giving you a list, a list of bunch of things, padding constructor, or material constructor, et cetera, et cetera. So it's basically creating objects. And then you can read each other. So this is one line of code. And there's actually a semicolon here, yes. This is one line of code, which on scaffold, and two up to semicolon. Okay? It's really weird, not like the code is actually useful, but it is imperative language. One line of code, I could have another line, I could have three lines before that, okay? I could put this into a variable, and use the variable here. So this is a code that I can mess with. I can do the formal, add things to this list, and then use that list. So in React, they use the different language, JSX, HTML like language. In Dart, in Flutter, they created this library of widgets. It's going to have this library, so that it keeps calling this constructor, and could limit in a way that looks like a kind of HTML code-ish. But we have one line of code that creates bunch of examples that are together. This is the idea. And yes, any questions here? Is it clear? I hope it's clear, because it's very important. Maybe I can zoom into it, if you want to see it closer. I guess I couldn't do the job. Okay? We will be dealing with this kind of code a lot. Okay, this is a function, build function, receive something, return something, and then it has one line of code, bunch of constructors. When you have such a code, what happens is, most things execute, and then get passed as parameters. So let's say what is created, and then pending is created, most of you are passed as children in column constructor. Column constructor is executed, its result is passed in the center, and this result passes carefully, etc. So as a result of this one line of code, I end up with a tree of widgets. Does it make sense? Okay? In one line of code, we say, okay, there is this, it has got to be children, and there is this, let's create this, let's create this, let's create, create, create, create, create, create. And then when you are done with that line of code, you have a tree of widgets. Okay? So this is code that created tree of widgets. Okay? And when you look at it, it looks like you described something, you say, there is this. Okay? But again, you could have put these into variables, etc. Another question, what's the difference between a class and an object? This is a very simple question, yes. A class is a blue print for an object. Yes. So out of a class, you create an object. Yes. Okay. So you have a person class, class person, and it has, it's a blue print of an object, right? I don't have a person yet, you know? And then, I say person. Create a person out of it, right? Person P. You are used to this kind of code in Java, right? Person P. Create a new person. Right? Everybody is very familiar with this kind of code. Person P. New person. Any problems here? Right? You are familiar with this kind of code. What does this line of code do? I'm not sure if you're familiar with what it actually does. Create a new person. Which part creates the instance? The new. New person, yes. But this part creates the instance. It actually creates a person. I could call you an actual person. And now, what it does afterwards? Assigns. Assigns. What does it mean to assign? How do you assign a person to what? It's a repeat reference to it. Reference, yes. You're talking about references, okay? So, thank you. You have to be very clear about what a reference is. It leaves a mistake. Don't worry about that. Don't confuse yourself with details. It's a memory address, stack, heap, blah, blah. A reference is a phone number. Okay? This guy has a phone. It is 555 something, blah, blah, blah. His phone number. Okay? This is a very nice analogy in real world. You can understand the phone number. Okay? But when the day comes and then I find that you don't understand references, it's your fault. Because I'm giving you the perfect example. Perfect analogy. Phone number. Okay? I have your phone number. Do I have you? No. You are here by yourself. A new person created you. Mom and dad, hopefully. And then back in the day, you know, and then he left. And then that created you back in the day. And then your phone number is given to P. Okay? So in my games course, I talk about this in much detail. But the idea is that what this line of thought does is it creates a new person. It's a phone number. Everybody's born with a cell phone. It's this. It's my cell phone. So, and then this code returns that number. Okay? What's P then? P is a piece of paper with a phone number on it. Okay? Or in somebody else's phone, a line of entry in the context list. That's what P is. Okay? So P has 5, 5, 6, 7, 8. So you can think of it like an arrow. Okay? If I have P, I need to call a name. Okay? Then, so if I make person P2 is equal to a new person. Let's also give like construct problems again. Okay? And then I create another person. Baby. Right? Now I have two people. Okay? If I say person P3 is equal to P, what happens? P3 references. What is P3? A new reference. A new person. A new piece of paper with a phone number on it. So P2 was this. Well, it shows same. Yes. P3 is also going to this guy because it holds us 5, 5, 5. Let's say this is just 5, 1, 1. 5, 1, 1. Okay? So this has to be the idea in your head. Otherwise, if you say I have a teacher telling me something, let me do whatever else. Let me check my Instagram, et cetera. One day, you will be faced with this truth. Okay? You are a junior developer. Things are breaking. You don't know why. You don't know what is changing these records. And then you want to cry. You want to say, well, don't call it like this. Call it like that because then it works. Okay? If you're not clear about this thing, if you think that P is the actual person, there will one day come in your life where you remember today and then you say, oh, I wish I had paid more attention. Okay? It's that important. Like I told you about touch typing. That's important. I told you a bunch of other things. This is another thing that's so important. If you want to be a programmer and you don't understand this, please, I mean, do something about it. Come talk to me. Let me tell you 10 more times and give you more different examples. Okay? So when you create an object, that object is created somewhere. And then for all the variables of that object, like person P, whatever this return, I am passing a group context into this function. This function returns a widget. This is a little class name. This is a class name. This is a class name. This is a class name. This is a class name. Everything that's a class name that looks like a value is a phone number. Okay? So basically this function is creating a scaffold object in memory and then returning its address, its phone number as the widget. This is a parent class of scaffold. Okay? I hope this makes sense. This is so important. These arrows, phone numbers. If you always come back, oh, you talk about phone numbers and try to think of it like that, you will be in the right track. Otherwise, you think, oh, I created P. I created a need. If you want a need, especially, it's going to be even more confusing. Okay? And you say, I'm easy for the baby. Somebody does this in somewhere and then you think you're talking to a need, but you're actually talking to the baby. Okay? So this is very important. And this is what's going on here. All these constructors, app bar is created in memory. Census created is all created in memory. And then they're going to turn this past this app bar, being passed to scaffold, is the phone number of that app bar being given to scaffold. So when the scaffold will show itself on the screen, it will start calling people, hey, you must be my app bar. Put yourself in here. Hey, you must be my whatever body. You are sensitive. Yes, put yourself in here. Okay? A lot of calling each other. You have to. Okay. So we have time. Are we out of time? You are out of time. Yes. So let's give a 10-minute break. After that, we point you. You can remind me about time.",

Please look at the couple of slides for assignments (marked with TODO) A problem: source of information Declarative Programming • In • Flutter • React/React Native • Jetpack Compose (Android) • Swift UI (iOS) we create the user interface in a style called “declarative programming”. • The kind of programming that most of you are used to is called “imperative programming”. • Android SDK • iOS SDK • What is the difference? What exactly are they? A computer program vs. an electronic circuit Imperative vs. Declarative Imperative Declarative • Giving orders in detail, with explicit instructions • Describing how it should be • Do this, then do that, then do this other thing. • Programmer has full control. • Programmer has full responsibility. • The computer is dumb. • Here is how I would like it to look like. I don’t have control over how exactly you are doing it. • Programmer has limited control. • Programmer has limited responsibility. • The computer is smart. Imperative vs. Declarative Imperative Declarative • Java • C++ • Step-by-step programming • HTML • SQL • Designing a circuit-like system • Procedural languages • Functional languages Is it just the language? • No, it’s the style. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mt7KnvnNGfk How are React Native and Flutter Declarative? • JavaScript and Dart are procedural languages. Shouldn’t it be imperative? • Answer: there are imperative parts of your code. The code that generates the UI is declarative. Declarative code from React Native and Flutter. Declarative code from React Native and Flutter. • Although the language is suitable for imperative code, the framework forces declarative code. • You create and tie UI elements together. • You do not modify or manage existing UI elements. • There is no such code in either: • txtField.text = “new text” • pnlMain.addChild(txtField) • Instead, there is such code: • new Panel(new TextField(“hello”)); UI Code • React Native • JSX • (short for JavaScript XML) • Similar to HTML • The description for the UI. Creates the UI. • Not actual code • Limited customization • No debugging • Flutter • Widget constructors • Named parameters • child for single child • children for multiple • Actual code! • Fully customizable • Fully debuggable UI is a tree • The UI is a tree structure • Creating a tree is easy • Modifying and maintaining a tree is difficult • This is why they chose declarative • We create and re-create UI elements. We do not manage existing elements. • What? How? • How do you make a text field say “one” first, and then say “two” after you press a button? Imperative Example • How do you make a text field say “one” first, and then say “two” after you press a button? Panel panel = new Panel(); TextField t = new TextField(); panel.add(t); t.text = “one”; Button b = new Button(); panel.add(b); b.addClickHandler(() { t.text = “two”; }); • THIS IS IMPERATIVE CODE. THIS MAKES SENSE. • This is not how React Native or Flutter do it. Declarative Example • How do you make a text field say “one” first, and then say “two” after you press a button? String currentValue = “one”; buildUi() { new Panel( new Text(currentValue), new Button( onClick: () { currentValue = “two”; rebuildUi(); } ) ) } • THIS IS DECLARATIVE CODE. THIS IS COUNTER-INTUITIVE • Why does React Native and Flutter use this pattern? Compare them. Panel panel = new Panel(); TextField t = new TextField(); panel.add(t); t.text = “one”; Button b = new Button(); panel.add(b); b.addClickHandler(() { String currentValue = “one”; buildUi() { new Panel( new Text(currentValue), new Button( onClick: () { currentValue = “two”; rebuildUi(); } ) t.text = “two”; }); ) } The difference • Imperative • Declarative • You create elements • You attach them together • You create elements • You attach them together • You keep a reference to elements • You do not keep a reference to elements • You are not responsible for maintaining elements • You do not give them orders • You create them and forget about them • You are responsible for mainaining them • You give them orders • You recreate them when something changes How can you keep recreating the UI? • Isn’t it inefficient? How can you keep recreating the UI? • Isn’t it inefficient? • NO! People smarter than us have implemented it carefully. • What you are creating is not the real UI element. It’s just a light description of them. • Very light data structure, system is ok with creating and destroying them quickly. • The framework finds the difference between two versions of the tree and modifies the UI elements whose description actually changed. • Carefully crafted framework to give you the ability to “just recreate the UI”. • DO NOT TRY TO OPTIMIZE ANYTHING ABOUT IT!!! • DO NOT CACHE UI ELEMENTS, ETC. KEEP RECREATING THEM.

Declarative is like giving the baker a picture and saying, 'I want a cake that looks exactly like this, with 'Happy Birthday' written on it.' You describe the end result, and the smart baker (the framework) figures out the most efficient way to make it, even if you change your mind about the writing later. For UIs, this means you just tell the system what you want to see, and it redraws or updates the necessary parts efficiently, rather than you trying to find and tweak individual UI components.",

    "transcript": "[0.00 - 6.00] I'm not going to interrupt the functionality of medium term schedule.\n[7.00 - 18.00] Now, it would be very nice if we had guest future to bring in respective pages in advance,\n[18.00 - 21.00] but that's not a very easy problem.\n[22.00 - 31.00] So, the basic functionality of memory management unit is to control this traffic.\n[31.00 - 39.00] So, that is the main issue over here.\n[39.00 - 46.00] Now, would the behavior of the program changing?\n[46.00 - 55.00] No, the activities of memory manager are transparent to the user.\n[55.00 - 63.00] Yes, the program may experience some slowdown because of maybe say high page all great,\n[63.00 - 70.00] but that should not affect anything from the programmer's point of view.\n[70.00 - 77.00] Now, the valid development we said could be used for checking if the page is in memory.\n[77.00 - 79.00] That's easy.\n[79.00 - 85.00] And we can do this very fast because this is a flight.\n[85.00 - 87.00] It's a hardware change.\n[87.00 - 97.00] Initially, all pages in the page table are invalid because no page has been loaded.\n[98.00 - 110.00] So, now this is going to tell the partially loaded program with the snapshot about valid and invalid.\n[110.00 - 114.00] So, I'm looking into logical data.\n[114.00 - 117.00] These are contents.\n[117.00 - 121.00] Now, I have a page table.\n[121.00 - 124.00] Some pages are in memory.\n[124.00 - 126.00] This is a snapshot.\n[126.00 - 139.00] So, page 0, page 2, and page 5 happens to be in memory because valid bits are set.\n[139.00 - 144.47] And thereabouts is these pointers.\n[144.47 - 154.47] So, the memory, for example, page 0 is at frame 4, page 2 is at frame 6, etc.\n[154.47 - 156.47] Okay.\n[156.47 - 160.47] Other pages not currently in memory.\n[160.47 - 164.47] Therefore, the respective flag is reset.\n[164.47 - 173.88] And those other pages of the program, this is complete program.\n[173.88 - 177.88] This is entire logical memory for this example.\n[177.88 - 179.88] Others are in backing store.\n[179.88 - 191.22] Now, pages would be brought in from backing store to memory as they are needed by the lazy swapper.\n[191.22 - 195.22] However, this is a disk operation.\n[195.22 - 202.22] Then you might question the speed because this operation takes very long.\n[203.22 - 212.22] One of the optimizations you can do is just prioritize these operations\n[212.22 - 222.60] and provide higher priority to these requests about backing store for accessing the disk.\n[222.60 - 224.60] That would be an optimization.\n[224.60 - 228.60] Other than that, that snapshot is valid.\n[228.60 - 237.60] Now, let us go and check the story of this complete picture.\n[237.60 - 245.60] First of all, you make a reference that is execution.\n[245.60 - 257.52] And when you check the page table, unfortunately the page is not in memory.\n[257.52 - 260.52] That's a trap to the operating system.\n[260.52 - 263.52] What is going to happen is the following.\n[263.52 - 272.52] It's not shown over here, but this process is going to be swapped out from CPU.\n[272.52 - 282.52] It is going to be moved into a block queue, which is different from other rating queues.\n[282.52 - 287.52] Because this process is waiting for pages.\n[287.52 - 292.52] So it's taken out that it's not shown over here.\n[292.52 - 301.52] Of the kernel that is the scheduler is going to take this process up.\n[301.52 - 304.52] The short-term scheduler, not the medium one.\n[305.52 - 318.52] And then the respective routing of the kernel will actually set up a page operation.\n[318.52 - 324.79] First of all, locate the page on the artist.\n[324.79 - 326.79] This is all transparency.\n[326.79 - 330.79] Find the page in the backing store.\n[330.79 - 334.79] The process is blocked in block queue.\n[334.79 - 338.79] Bring in that page to memory.\n[338.79 - 343.79] Of course, to be able to do that, it needs to find a free frame,\n[343.79 - 346.79] which is another story that we will tell later on.\n[346.79 - 349.79] It's not very easy because there is shortage over here.\n[349.79 - 353.79] If you cannot find a free frame, you need to choose a victim.\n[353.79 - 359.79] With the means, swap out that page to the backing store.\n[359.79 - 374.58] Well, if the copy of that page in backing store is the same with the copy of the page, which is victim,\n[374.58 - 378.58] you don't have to do swap out because the two copies are identical.\n[378.58 - 381.58] I will address that issue again.\n[383.02 - 387.02] Anyway, at this point, we found a free frame.\n[387.02 - 391.02] And then we have updated our page table.\n[391.02 - 394.02] Now this is valid now.\n[394.02 - 405.02] And then once the page table is updated, then there will be an interrupt to the operating system,\n[405.02 - 410.02] saying that this process is ready to execute.\n[410.02 - 414.02] Therefore, the process is going to be moved to the routing queue.\n[414.02 - 420.02] And then it will resume execution depending on the shorter schedules activities.\n[420.02 - 424.02] So that is restart over here.\n[424.02 - 427.02] So this is the story of page 4.\n[427.02 - 430.02] That needs to be understood very well.\n[430.02 - 432.02] Is everything in here?\n[432.02 - 433.02] No.\n[433.02 - 438.02] For example, this picture does not tell you that the process is blocked.\n[438.02 - 441.02] You have to assume that.\n[441.02 - 448.02] This picture is not telling you how you have found the free frame.\n[448.02 - 454.02] Those issues I will talk about in a minute.\n[454.02 - 459.02] So, few demand pages I already said.\n[459.02 - 467.02] In the beginning of the program, there is no page in memory.\n[467.02 - 476.02] Now at this point, it's a good idea to talk about a very important phenomenon called locality of reference.\n[476.02 - 479.02] What is locality of reference?\n[479.02 - 491.02] During execution, people made a lot of observations to figure out that in certain time windows,\n[491.02 - 497.56] the program needs only certain pages for execution.\n[497.56 - 500.56] That is called locality of reference.\n[500.56 - 508.56] So if you can maintain those pages in memory, then the program will execute for a while.\n[508.56 - 510.56] Of course, not forever.\n[510.56 - 516.56] After some time, there will be a game changing locality of reference.\n[516.56 - 524.56] And then it is going to actually exercise page 4.\n[524.56 - 535.56] So at this point, you can just move on and figure out the locality of reference by some means.\n[535.56 - 541.56] Now, this slide is not a very good one.\n[541.56 - 544.56] Let me tell you a story about this one.\n[544.56 - 550.56] An instruction in general needs more than one page to execute.\n[550.56 - 552.56] That is an important factor.\n[552.56 - 554.56] Retain.\n[554.56 - 559.56] An instruction may need more than one page for execution.\n[559.56 - 567.56] So during the execution of an instruction, there can be a page board.\n[567.56 - 573.56] Of course, that would stall the execution of that instruction.\n[573.56 - 579.56] And then it will start all over again once the page is in memory.\n[579.56 - 585.56] So that is the instruction restart.\n[585.56 - 590.56] Okay, now coming back to the free frames.\n[590.56 - 603.56] Well, we said we need to find a free frame so that we can read in the new page.\n[603.56 - 605.56] Let me tell you a little bit about this.\n[605.56 - 608.56] I have been telling you for a long time.\n[608.56 - 610.56] You are different, aren't you?\n[610.56 - 614.56] So the first lesson was something like this.\n[614.56 - 619.56] I am going to tell you a fairy tale of the whole period.\n[619.56 - 621.56] Do you remember that?\n[621.56 - 625.56] I mean, this is just the difficulty of everything.\n[625.56 - 629.56] Everything is very closely related to each other.\n[629.56 - 633.56] Well, let me tell you a little bit about waking up.\n[633.56 - 635.56] What do you see in the open rooms?\n[635.56 - 640.56] There is always a reference to the snows.\n[640.56 - 643.56] There is a reference to the schedule.\n[643.56 - 646.56] Why? Because the schedule is in the work.\n[646.56 - 651.56] Therefore, if we cannot understand the activity of the schedule,\n[651.56 - 654.56] it is very difficult to understand how the page works.\n[654.56 - 656.56] For example, it is like a shape.\n[656.56 - 660.56] Therefore, until the end of this period,\n[660.56 - 664.56] we come to the file management, the disk management.\n[664.56 - 669.56] But this time, the schedule will be the main manager.\n[669.56 - 671.56] They will be the main manager.\n[671.56 - 676.56] Therefore, the story continues in this way.\n[676.56 - 680.56] Of course, there is technology in it,\n[680.56 - 686.56] but we are starting with a very powerful concept.\n[686.56 - 689.56] How did we build today's story?\n[689.56 - 692.56] We said that today's story is like this.\n[692.56 - 697.56] We said that there is no need to be in that period\n[697.56 - 703.56] of time for a program to be able to work.\n[703.56 - 708.56] We said that it would be necessary to have a program\n[708.56 - 711.56] to be able to work in that period of time.\n[711.56 - 714.56] We also said that it would be possible.\n[714.56 - 718.56] And we started from there.\n[718.56 - 720.56] So, let us move on.\n[720.56 - 722.56] So, free frames.\n[722.56 - 724.56] Of course, we have a linked list\n[724.56 - 729.56] that is maintaining the available frames\n[729.56 - 732.56] for page swapping swapout operation.\n[733.56 - 739.56] So, in many cases now this is zero fill of demand.\n[739.56 - 742.56] You clear the page contents\n[742.56 - 747.56] when you just choose that frame as a victim.\n[747.56 - 750.56] You just clear the contents.\n[750.56 - 753.56] The rest is just the maintenance of a free frame.\n[753.56 - 757.56] So, the stages in demand page are very similar\n[757.56 - 759.56] to the previous story.\n[759.56 - 761.56] So, let me tell you the story.\n[761.56 - 768.56] So, this part, remember, I said, is not shown over here.\n[768.56 - 772.56] Trap to the operating system and block the process.\n[772.56 - 774.56] I said, remember.\n[774.56 - 778.56] So, that is the story we are telling now.\n[778.56 - 780.56] Trap to the operating system.\n[780.56 - 784.56] Then save the user registers and process state.\n[784.56 - 789.56] And then figure out that interrupt was a page fault.\n[789.56 - 791.56] And check page reference.\n[791.56 - 795.56] Now here, we know that something went wrong.\n[795.56 - 799.56] In other words, the page is not in memory.\n[799.56 - 802.56] However, we should be doing other checks.\n[802.56 - 807.56] Remember the last week's lecture, we said,\n[807.56 - 809.56] is that a legitimate reference?\n[809.56 - 814.56] In other words, is that reference a legal one?\n[814.56 - 819.56] Maybe this is a reference to someone else's data.\n[819.56 - 823.56] In that case, this is not page fault.\n[823.56 - 827.56] The operating system must figure that out\n[827.56 - 832.56] and must not bring in that page to memory\n[832.56 - 837.56] because this program is making an illegal reference.\n[837.56 - 842.56] So, that step is now moved into this portion.\n[842.56 - 849.51] In other words, this is the portion where that happened.\n[849.51 - 850.51] Is that clear?\n[850.51 - 852.51] So, there is no gap in the story.\n[852.51 - 857.51] Check the legality and that set up a disk operation.\n[857.51 - 860.51] So, this operation has many things, you know,\n[860.51 - 863.51] wait in queue for this device\n[863.51 - 867.51] and then be the transfer, et cetera.\n[867.51 - 869.51] CPU is doing this stuff.\n[869.51 - 872.51] CPU is executing something else.\n[872.51 - 876.51] And when it's complete, receive an interrupt from the disk,\n[876.51 - 880.51] save registers and process of the other user.\n[880.51 - 883.51] That is just a story of context between,\n[883.51 - 885.51] update the page table,\n[885.51 - 888.51] and then just wait your term into ridicule.\n[888.51 - 892.51] So, this story is the part\n[892.51 - 898.78] that is not explained in this picture.\n[898.78 - 903.78] That is summarizing the scheduling activities to it.\n[903.78 - 905.78] But we know that, already we know that.\n[905.78 - 907.78] All of them we know.\n[907.78 - 911.78] So, coming back to the performance.\n[911.78 - 916.78] We say, well, we do have worries about performance.\n[916.78 - 917.78] Why?\n[917.78 - 921.78] Because I am setting up disk operations\n[921.78 - 925.78] and disk operations take a long time.\n[925.78 - 929.78] I started the story with a memory read\n[929.78 - 933.78] which is way up faster than disk read.\n[933.78 - 937.78] And if I am to implement this system,\n[937.78 - 940.78] what's going to happen to the performance?\n[940.78 - 943.78] Let us do some math over here.\n[943.78 - 948.78] First of all, if there is a page fault,\n[948.78 - 951.78] then there is a trap to the operating system.\n[951.78 - 953.78] We said, remember the picture,\n[953.78 - 956.78] therefore we have to service the interrupt\n[956.78 - 960.78] and then bring in the page, restart the process.\n[960.78 - 963.78] These things will take time.\n[963.78 - 965.78] So, to start with the computation,\n[965.78 - 971.78] we have a very crucial parameter called page fault rate.\n[971.78 - 975.78] In other words, throughout the educational programs,\n[975.78 - 983.29] what is the percentage of page faults?\n[983.29 - 986.29] That number we call P, a probability.\n[986.29 - 990.66] It's between 0 and 1.\n[990.66 - 993.66] If it's 0, no page fault.\n[993.66 - 997.66] So, now, we can just use the weighted formula\n[997.66 - 1001.66] to compute the effective memory access time.\n[1001.66 - 1006.66] Effective access time is\n[1006.66 - 1010.66] the ordinary memory access that we have computed last week\n[1010.66 - 1016.66] multiplied by the probability that the page is in memory,\n[1016.66 - 1024.66] which is 1 minus 2, plus probability that page is not in memory,\n[1024.66 - 1028.66] all the story of the cycle of this picture over here.\n[1028.66 - 1034.00] That we divide into three at this point,\n[1034.00 - 1036.00] but not that important.\n[1036.00 - 1040.00] Page fault rate, swap page, out swap page, et cetera.\n[1040.00 - 1045.00] That is the overall service time.\n[1045.00 - 1049.00] So, let us do some math with real figures.\n[1049.00 - 1057.00] So, start with memory access time for 200 nanoseconds\n[1057.00 - 1062.00] and page fault service time of 8 nanoseconds.\n[1062.00 - 1069.00] As you see, these figures are quite uncooperable to each other.\n[1069.00 - 1073.00] So, effective access time, just plug in the numbers\n[1073.00 - 1080.00] with the page fault rate assumed as...\n[1080.00 - 1085.00] Well, just keep it as p at this point in the formula\n[1085.00 - 1087.00] and plug in the numbers.\n[1087.00 - 1089.00] That is what we get.\n[1089.00 - 1094.00] As you see, the page fault part of the formula\n[1094.00 - 1099.00] is the dominating part of the computation.\n[1099.00 - 1107.34] Okay, if page fault rate p is 1 over 1000,\n[1107.34 - 1115.72] then this turns out to be page point 2 microseconds.\n[1115.72 - 1120.72] That is slowed down by a factor of more than 40\n[1120.72 - 1123.72] because we have 200 nanoseconds.\n[1123.72 - 1125.72] That's terrible.\n[1125.72 - 1130.72] So, how can we improve this?\n[1130.72 - 1135.72] The only way up is to reduce p.\n[1135.72 - 1143.97] So, you say, okay, I want to compute the whole thing backwards.\n[1143.97 - 1150.97] I don't want a slow down more than 10 percent.\n[1150.97 - 1157.97] So, if that is the picture,\n[1157.97 - 1167.97] then you plug it to formula the figures with p ket\n[1167.97 - 1175.97] and your effective access time should not be more than 220,\n[1175.97 - 1178.97] which is 10 percent.\n[1178.97 - 1181.97] Be careful with the apples and oranges.\n[1181.97 - 1186.97] This is in nanoseconds, written in nanoseconds.\n[1186.97 - 1191.97] So, for p, look at your probability.\n[1191.97 - 1201.97] That is one page fault in every 400,000 references.\n[1201.97 - 1205.97] So, now comes the big question.\n[1205.97 - 1215.97] How am I going to attain a page fault rate of this low?\n[1215.97 - 1217.97] Very small.\n[1217.97 - 1219.97] The answer is easy.\n[1219.97 - 1221.97] Use largely memory.\n[1221.97 - 1225.97] Accommodate more pages in memory.\n[1225.97 - 1229.97] Well, of course, we have improvements with cache.\n[1229.97 - 1231.97] You all know that.\n[1231.97 - 1236.97] We use cache to improve memory access time.\n[1236.97 - 1241.97] Remember, this included cache references to the page table.\n[1241.97 - 1244.97] Remember, when you have page table,\n[1244.97 - 1247.97] you have two stages.\n[1247.97 - 1249.97] One memory for the page table\n[1249.97 - 1255.97] and then another memory for the actual data.\n[1255.97 - 1258.97] So, that is in here.\n[1258.97 - 1265.97] So, you can improve things quite a lot by using cache.\n[1265.97 - 1268.97] So, that should be the way to go.\n[1268.97 - 1272.97] And we do have L1, L2, and L3 caches.\n[1272.97 - 1277.97] Now, optimizations, what people did about this?\n[1277.97 - 1281.97] Well, they strived for this quite a lot.\n[1281.97 - 1288.97] Okay, first of all, speed up the swap operations.\n[1288.97 - 1293.97] So, page in page out faster than regular I.O.\n[1293.97 - 1296.97] As I said, that would just bring us to the issue\n[1296.97 - 1301.97] of prioritizing the disk operations.\n[1301.97 - 1307.97] And only one could be copy the entire number of pages\n[1307.97 - 1309.97] to swap space.\n[1309.97 - 1310.97] This is cheap.\n[1310.97 - 1318.25] Yes, you can do this because if a page is in hard disk,\n[1318.25 - 1320.25] that is I.O.\n[1320.25 - 1324.25] But if the page is in swap space,\n[1324.25 - 1327.25] that is prioritize the I.O.\n[1327.25 - 1332.25] Therefore, an optimization could be offline\n[1332.25 - 1337.25] just to migrate all of the pages of the executing program\n[1337.25 - 1339.25] to swap space.\n[1339.25 - 1341.25] So, that is natural.\n[1341.25 - 1346.25] So, that would also be an improvement.\n[1346.25 - 1351.25] Okay, the other one is many other things.\n[1351.25 - 1355.25] Demand page from program binary on disk.\n[1355.25 - 1357.25] Okay.\n[1357.25 - 1359.25] You need that.\n",

What exactly are they?\n\n\fA computer program vs. an electronic circuit\n\n\fImperative vs. Declarative\nImperative\n\nDeclarative\n\n• Giving orders in detail, with\nexplicit instructions\n\n• Describing how it should be\n\n• Do this, then do that, then do this\nother thing.\n\n• Programmer has full control.\n• Programmer has full responsibility.\n• The computer is dumb.\n\n• Here is how I would like it to look\nlike. I don’t have control over how\nexactly you are doing it.\n\n• Programmer has limited control.\n• Programmer has limited\nresponsibility.\n• The computer is smart.\n\n\fImperative vs. Declarative\nImperative\n\nDeclarative\n\n• Java\n• C++\n• Step-by-step programming\n\n• HTML\n• SQL\n• Designing a circuit-like system\n\n• Procedural languages\n\n• Functional languages\n\n\fIs it just the language?\n• No, it’s the style.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mt7KnvnNGfk\n\n\fHow are React Native and Flutter Declarative?\n• JavaScript and Dart are procedural languages. Shouldn’t it be imperative?\n• Answer: there are imperative parts of your code. The code that generates\nthe UI is declarative.\n\n\fDeclarative code from React Native and Flutter.\n\n\fDeclarative code from React Native and Flutter.\n• Although the language is suitable for imperative code, the framework\nforces declarative code.\n• You create and tie UI elements together.\n• You do not modify or manage existing UI elements.\n• There is no such code in either:\n• txtField.text = “new text”\n• pnlMain.addChild(txtField)\n\n• Instead, there is such code:\n• new Panel(new TextField(“hello”));\n\n\fUI Code\n• React Native\n• JSX\n• (short for JavaScript XML)\n\n• Similar to HTML\n• The description for the UI. Creates\nthe UI.\n• Not actual code\n• Limited customization\n• No debugging\n\n• Flutter\n• Widget constructors\n• Named parameters\n• child for single child\n• children for multiple\n\n• Actual code!\n• Fully customizable\n• Fully debuggable\n\n\fUI is a tree\n• The UI is a tree structure\n• Creating a tree is easy\n• Modifying and maintaining a tree is difficult\n\n• This is why they chose declarative\n\n• We create and re-create UI elements. We do not manage existing\nelements.\n• What? How?\n• How do you make a text field say “one” first, and then say “two” after you press a\nbutton?\n\n\fImperative Example\n• How do you make a text field say “one” first, and then say “two” after you press\na button?\nPanel panel = new Panel();\nTextField t = new TextField();\npanel.add(t);\nt.text = “one”;\nButton b = new Button();\npanel.add(b);\nb.addClickHandler(() {\nt.text = “two”;\n\n});\n• THIS IS IMPERATIVE CODE. THIS MAKES SENSE.\n• This is not how React Native or Flutter do it.\n\n\fDeclarative Example\n• How do you make a text field say “one” first, and then say “two” after you press a\nbutton?\nString currentValue = “one”;\nbuildUi() {\nnew Panel(\nnew Text(currentValue),\nnew Button(\nonClick: () {\ncurrentValue = “two”;\nrebuildUi();\n}\n)\n\n)\n\n}\n\n• THIS IS DECLARATIVE CODE. THIS IS COUNTER-INTUITIVE\n• Why does React Native and Flutter use this pattern?\n\n\fCompare them.\nPanel panel = new Panel();\nTextField t = new TextField();\npanel.add(t);\nt.text = “one”;\nButton b = new Button();\npanel.add(b);\nb.addClickHandler(() {\n\nString currentValue = “one”;\nbuildUi() {\nnew Panel(\nnew Text(currentValue),\nnew Button(\nonClick: () {\ncurrentValue = “two”;\nrebuildUi();\n}\n)\n\nt.text = “two”;\n\n});\n\n)\n\n}\n\n\fThe difference\n• Imperative\n\n• Declarative\n\n• You create elements\n• You attach them together\n\n• You create elements\n• You attach them together\n\n• You keep a reference to elements\n\n• You do not keep a reference to elements\n• You are not responsible for maintaining\nelements\n• You do not give them orders\n• You create them and forget about them\n\n• You are responsible for mainaining them\n• You give them orders\n\n• You recreate them when something\nchanges\n\n\fHow can you keep recreating the UI?\n• Isn’t it inefficient?\n\n\fHow can you keep recreating the UI?\n• Isn’t it inefficient?\n• NO! People smarter than us have implemented it carefully.\n• What you are creating is not the real UI element. It’s just a light description of them.\n• Very light data structure, system is ok with creating and destroying them quickly.\n\n• The framework finds the difference between two versions of the tree and modifies the UI\nelements whose description actually changed.\n• Carefully crafted framework to give you the ability to “just recreate the UI”.\n\n• DO NOT TRY TO OPTIMIZE ANYTHING ABOUT IT!!!\n• DO NOT CACHE UI ELEMENTS, ETC. KEEP RECREATING THEM.\n\n\fPlanning and Creating a Declarative UI\n• How should you go about planning your UI?\n• https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html\n•FilterableProductTable\n• SearchBar\n• ProductTable\n• ProductCategoryRow\n• ProductRow\n\n\fHow does data flow?\n\nhttps://livebook.manning.com/book/react-in-action/chapter-3/112\n\n\fHow does data flow?\n\nhttps://www.slideshare.net/pheadra4/react-46872849?from_action=save\n\n\fHow does data flow?\n\nhttps://www.slideshare.net/pheadra4/react-46872849?from_action=save\n\n\fHow does data flow?\n• Unidirectional data flow\n• Top to bottom\n• Props/constructor arguments (fixed)\n• Data being passed down when\ncomponent is created (yellow).\n\n• State (changing)\n• Temporary data that changes with user\ninput or other events\n• Triggers a rebuild of subtree.

    "transcript": "[00:00:00 – 00:00:15] Good morning everyone and welcome to today's lecture on Python functions. I'm really excited to dive into this topic because functions are absolutely fundamental to programming.\n\n[00:00:15 – 00:00:28] They're one of the most important concepts you'll learn. So let's start with the basics. What exactly is a function?\n\n[00:00:28 – 00:00:45] Well, a function is essentially a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. Think of it like a machine - you put something in, it does some work, and it gives you something back.\n\n[00:00:45 – 00:01:02] The beauty of functions is that once you write them, you can use them over and over again without rewriting the same code.\n\n[00:01:02 – 00:01:18] Now, why should we use functions? There are several compelling reasons. First, code reusability. Instead of copying and pasting the same code everywhere, you write it once as a function and call it whenever you need it.\n\n[00:01:18 – 00:01:35] Second, organization. Functions help you break down complex programs into smaller, manageable pieces. Third, maintainability. When you need to fix a bug or make a change, you only need to update it in one place.\n\n[00:01:35 – 00:01:52] Let me show you how to define a function. We use the 'def' keyword, followed by the function name, then parentheses, and a colon. The function body is indented.\n\n[00:01:52 – 00:02:08] For example, def greet colon, then on the next line, indented, print hello. That's it. That's a simple function.\n\n[00:02:08 – 00:02:25] Now let's talk about parameters and arguments. These terms are often confused but there's an important distinction. Parameters are the variables you define in the function definition.\n\n[00:02:25 – 00:02:42] Arguments are the actual values you pass when you call the function. So if I have def add open parenthesis a comma b close parenthesis, a and b are parameters. When I call add 5 comma 3, 5 and 3 are arguments.\n\n[00:02:42 – 00:03:00] There are different types of arguments. Positional arguments where the order matters. Keyword arguments where you specify the parameter name. And default parameters that have fallback values if nothing is provided.\n\n[00:03:00 – 00:03:18] Finally, let's discuss the return statement. When you want a function to give back a result, you use return. For example, def add a b colon return a plus b. The function computes the sum and returns it.\n\n[00:03:18 – 00:03:35] If you don't use return, the function returns None by default. Also, return immediately exits the function, so any code after return won't execute.\n\n[00:03:35 – 00:03:52] Remember, good functions are small and focused. One function should do one thing and do it well. Use descriptive names so others can understand what your function does just by reading the name.\n\n[00:03:52 – 00:04:05] And always document your functions with docstrings. Any questions so far? Great, let's move on to some practice exercises.",

When P0 executes \r\nwait(Q), it must wait until P1 executes signal(Q) \r\n However, P1 is waiting until P0 execute signal(S). \r\n Since these signal() operations will never be executed, P0 and P1 are \r\ndeadlocked. \r\nDeadlock\r\n\r\n--- Slide 58 (Extracted) ---\r\n Starvation – indefinite blocking   \r\n• A process may never be removed from the semaphore queue in \r\nwhich it is suspended \r\n Priority Inversion – Scheduling problem when lower-priority process \r\nholds a lock needed by higher-priority process \r\n Solved via priority-inheritance protocol \r\n \r\n \r\nOther Forms of Deadlock\r\n\r\n--- Slide 59 (Extracted) ---\r\nPriority Inheritance Protocol \r\n Consider the scenario with  three processes P1, P2, and P3. P1 has \r\nthe highest priority, P2 the next highest, and P3 the lowest.  \r\n Assume P3 is assigned a resource R that P1 wants.  \r\n• Thus, P1 must wait for P3 to finish using the resource. However, \r\nP2 becomes runnable and preempts P3.  \r\n• What has happened is that P2 - a process with a lower priority \r\nthan P1 - has indirectly prevented P3 from gaining access to the \r\nresource. \r\n To prevent this from occurring, a priority inheritance protocol is \r\nused. This simply allows the priority of the highest thread waiting to \r\naccess a shared resource to be assigned to the thread currently using \r\nthe resource. Thus, the current owner of the resource is assigned the \r\npriority of the highest priority thread wishing to acquire the resource.\r\n\r\n--- Slide 60 (Extracted) ---\r\nEnd of Chapter 6\r\n\r\n\n> 🤖 **[Yapay Zeka Görsel Analizi]**\n> Görsel, Carnotaurus türünde bir dinozorun çizimini gösteriyor.
