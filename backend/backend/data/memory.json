      "statement": "While advanced state management solutions (e.g., Redux, MobX) exist, developers should master basic state management (e.g., using `setState`) first, and only adopt complex solutions when a clear need arises.",
      "why": "This provides crucial practical guidance for students, preventing them from prematurely adopting overly complex solutions before understanding the foundational principles. This is a common pitfall that can lead to unnecessary complexity in projects."
    },
    {
      "statement": "Modern declarative UI frameworks like Flutter offer significant 'developer luxuries' such as hot reload and UI inspection tools, drastically improving development speed and experience.",
      "why": "Although not a core conceptual paradigm, the lecturer emphasizes these practical benefits extensively at the beginning of the lecture. Understanding these features highlights the appeal and efficiency gains of using modern declarative frameworks for mobile development."
    },
    {
      "statement": "Unidirectional data flow, managed through 'props' (fixed data passed down) and 'state' (changing data causing rebuilds), is a fundamental principle for organizing data in declarative UIs.",
      "why": "This is a critical practical concept for designing and implementing interactive declarative UIs. Students must understand how data moves between components and triggers updates, which is central to building responsive applications."
    },
    {
      "statement": "The 'source of information' problem and the inherent tree structure of UIs are core difficulties in imperative UI development that declarative programming aims to solve.",
      "why": "This highlights the primary motivation and advantages of the declarative approach, providing essential context for *why* this paradigm shift occurred. Understanding the problems (e.g., spaghetti code, difficulty with tree traversal) helps appreciate the solution and its design principles."
    },
    {
      "statement": "Declarative UI frameworks (like Flutter, React Native) abstract away complex UI management by making the developer re-create the UI description on every state change, and the framework efficiently determines actual UI updates.",
      "why": "This explains *how* declarative UI works in practice and addresses a common developer intuition about inefficiency. Understanding this mechanism is crucial for using these frameworks correctly and avoiding anti-patterns, which is vital for performance and maintainability."
    },
    {
      "statement": "Declarative programming is a fundamental shift from imperative programming, where you describe *what* the UI should look like rather than *how* to build or update it.",
      "why": "This is the core conceptual understanding required for modern mobile UI development. Misunderstanding this leads to incorrect development patterns and difficulty in grasping framework concepts. Essential for exam questions on programming paradigms."

      "statement": "For beginners, it is critical to master basic state management (e.g., `setState`) and build a couple of applications with it before attempting to use advanced state management solutions (Redux, MobX, Provider), ensuring a deep understanding of the underlying problems these libraries solve.",

      "statement": "Unidirectional data flow is a fundamental architectural principle in declarative UIs, where data moves 'top to bottom' via fixed 'props' (or constructor arguments) and changing 'state,' while interactions and changes propagate 'bottom to top' through 'events.'",
      "why": "This explains the structured way data is managed in declarative UIs, directly combating the 'spaghetti code' and 'source of information' problems. Understanding this flow is essential for designing and debugging declarative UI components."
